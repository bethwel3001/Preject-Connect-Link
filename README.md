**Explanation of Each Folder/File**
1. app.py:
The main entry point that initializes the Flask app and runs the server.

2. config.py:
Stores app configurations (e.g., database URL, secret keys).

3. /connectlink/:
Contains backend logic like models, routes, forms, and utility functions. This is the core package of the application.

4. /templates/:
HTML templates using Jinja2 for rendering dynamic content.
base.html will serve as the base layout for other pages (like a master template with a consistent navbar and footer).

5. /static/:
Holds static files (CSS, JavaScript, and images).
This folder ensures that frontend assets are served efficiently.

6. /instance/:
Stores instance-specific files, such as SQLite DB (for local testing) and config files not intended for version control.

7. /tests/:
Contains all the unit and integration tests to ensure the application works as expected.

8. migrations/:
If you use Flask-Migrate for handling database migrations, this folder stores migration scripts.

9. requirements.txt:
Contains all the Python dependencies needed to run the project (e.g., Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-WTF).
10. .env:
Stores sensitive environment variables (e.g., secret keys, API tokens).

11. /docs/:
Useful for documenting your API endpoints and providing usage instructions for future developers or contributors.

**Technologies Used**
1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. Backend: Python *Flask*
3. Database: SQLite (for local testing) / PostgreSQL or *MySQL* (for production) 
4. Authentication: Flask-Login
5. Forms & Validation: Flask-WTF
6. Migrations: Flask-Migrate

**Headaches to Expect ðŸ˜…**
1. Authentication issues: Handling login sessions and password encryption securely.
2. Database management: Ensuring migrations run smoothly during development and deployment.
3. Frontend-backend sync: Making sure data flows seamlessly between the two.
4. Form validation quirks: Client-side vs. server-side validation conflicts.
5. Deployment troubles: Configuring the environment and database correctly during deployment to platforms like Netlify or Heroku.
